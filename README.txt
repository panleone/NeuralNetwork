Implement a neural network from scratch in modern C++.

Currently supports:

- ReLU activation layer
- Fully Connected layer
- Convolutional layer

The only external library is OpenBlas https://github.com/OpenMathLib/OpenBLAS, for fast linear algebra operations.

The neural network performance is tested on the MNIST-1D dataset https://github.com/greydanus/mnist1d.
